#### Why forking a working PoC for an old k8s version
* Cause I was working on it and I have missed a little detail. So I want to dig it again (play with k8s, volumes etc)
* Provide a pretty wrapper to the PoC that directly provide a shell
* Old/deprecated versions never existed in production environment (did it?!!)
